								&emsp;&emsp;Traditional water desalination membranes lack the filtration efficiency
								required in order to serve as a universal method of obtaining purified water. [1]
								However, recent advances in graphene-based membranes efficiency have demonstrated that
								graphene can fulfill the increasing global demand for purified water. [2]
								<br/>
								In 2018, Cape Town, Africa came within days of running out of water. With the eminent
								threat of severe dehydration and resulting catastrophic organ failure, the citizens of
								Cape Town became one of many groups to realize the dry reality of running out of
								drinkable water. The depletion of existing freshwater sources due to overuse and drought
								has accelerated the need towards finding water sources that can keep up with human
								demand. Not only is potable water essential for drinking, but the 2011-2017 California
								Drought demonstrated the knock-on impact of water scarcity on agriculture and other
								critical industries. Saltwater desalination provides hope towards adapting to meet this
								need, though it has yet to reach widespread popularity: “Although the oceans and seas
								contain 97% of the world’s water, desalination today only accounts for a fraction of a
								percent of the world’s potable water supply.” [3]</p>

							<h2>Industrial Popularity</h2>
							<p class="post_p">
								&emsp;&emsp;While existing saltwater desalination installations have largely adopted reverse osmosis
								for production, all these installations have chosen traditional polymer membranes over
								graphene-based membranes due to their historical production-level reliability. In 2019,
								69% of the roughly 160,000 desalination plants around the globe had adopted reverse
								osmosis as their primary filtration technique, yet all of these facilities rely on some
								form of traditional polymer membranes. [4] Most of these facilities were constructed
								since the 1980s, but up until recently traditional polymer membranes were the only real
								option for reverse osmosis. For the past three decades, traditional polymer membranes
								have been the go-to material for reverse osmosis and have demonstrated their reliability
								in the roughly 130,000 existing reverse osmosis plants.<br/>
								Unfortunately, graphene membranes have not yet had their own chance to prove themselves
								on an industrial level. While graphene has been experimented with since the 1950s, it
								was only within the last ten years that graphene-membrane research has caught the
								attention of researchers. [1] This explosion of research interest stemmed from the
								recent development of methodologies to synthesize large graphene sheets [1] and to
								assemble those sheets into multilayer membranes. [5] Despite all this attention devoted
								to graphene membranes, traditional polymer membranes still have had a 3-decade lead in
								the reverse osmosis process. This historical monopoly explains why new installations
								still choose polymer membranes, as these installations only want to utilize technology
								that has already proven itself in the field. As no installation is willing to experiment
								with graphene due to the potential risk of experimental technologies, it becomes a
								catch-22 where graphene membranes cannot gain the approval to prove themselves in
								production precisely because they haven’t already been proven. This would be equivalent
								to being judged on college grades when attempting to apply to college, as it is
								paradoxically impossible to fulfill the requirements. It would only take a single
								installation to start the necessary momentum, but until that point where graphene
								membranes get their foot in the door they are at a significant disadvantage to
								challenging the traditional membrane monopoly and convincing desalination installations
								to adopt graphene membranes.

							<h2>Ease of manufacture</h2>
							<p class="post_p">
								&emsp;&emsp;Despite this setback, graphene membrane’s significantly easier manufacturing process
								over traditional membranes still makes it an appealing replacement to traditional
								membranes. In 1980, John Cadotte pioneered the procedure to manufacturing traditional
								polymer membranes that largely remains unchanged today. The layers are created
								individually one at a time from a liquid dried on a supporting sulfur-based surface. [6]
								While the final polymer membranes are relatively durable, during assembly the individual
								layers are highly prone to tearing and must be handled especially carefully. Any
								defects, even at the microscopic level, mean that the layer is not suitable and must be
								disposed of. Very carefully, these layers are laminated on top of each other to form the
								finished membrane. The materials used in the manufacturing process are environmentally
								harmful if not properly contained, which adds cost and complexity to the procedure in
								order to manage these hazardous waste products. [6] The manufacture of traditional
								polymer membranes is far from ideal, and this difficulty is partially responsible for
								the slow growth of new desalination installations.<br/>
								&emsp;&emsp;Graphene membranes on the other hand have proven to be much easier to work with due to
								its simplicity and abundance in nature. Similarly to how coal forms within the earth,
								the atomically thin graphene sheets self-assemble from carbon molecules just through the
								application of pressure. [5] Some of the most popular manufacturing methods utilize
								industrial rollers that supply the required pressure to press the loose carbon into
								uniform layers. [1] Not only do graphene membranes practically assemble themselves, but
								the hexagonal structure that naturally forms gives the graphene membrane both perfect
								flatness and strength. This strength enables graphene layers to be much more resistant
								to tearing and makes them significantly easier to handle and mass-produce. Since plain
								graphene membranes are made entirely out of carbon, the raw material is easy to find in
								nature and is environmentally benign. While this graphene structural backbone is
								naturally simplistic, it also has the flexibility to accept chemical modifications that
								alter its properties. [2] This ease of modification has inspired the diversity in
								graphene-based membrane research and even makes complex graphene membrane production
								feasible. Graphene membranes demonstrate significant improvements in manufacturing ease
								and sustainability compared to traditional membranes at all levels of membrane
								complexity, and this ease means that graphene manufacturing is better suited to meet the
								increasing demand for desalination membranes.

							<h2>Filtration Efficiency</h2>
							<p class="post_p">
								&emsp;&emsp;Not only are graphene membranes more environmental and simpler to manufacture, graphene
								membranes critically outperform traditional membranes for filtration efficiency and
								resultingly energy efficiency. When traditional polymer membranes were initially
								adopted, they served as a significant improvement in power and production efficiencies
								over the existing thermal technologies. [4] However, within the past 30 years these
								traditional polymer membranes have only seen a small 2x improvement in overall membrane
								efficiency. [1] Due to the structure of polymer membranes, research into improving the
								membrane efficiency have not been able to deliver the significant improvements in
								membrane efficiency to keep up with increasing water demand. Not only does membrane
								efficiency affect the quality and quantity of water produced, but it also relates to the
								power costs of the reverse osmosis process. For a typical desalination facility, the
								power costs alone can account for up to 50% of the total costs of constructing and
								operating the facility. [7] These power costs are inversely proportional to membrane
								efficiency, as lower efficiency means that more pumps and more energy are required to
								force the water through the membrane. This combination is especially discouraging to
								saltwater desalination, as the immense pressure and power requirements can place severe
								strain on regional power availability. This combination of high power consumption and
								relatively low water yield has kept all but the most desperate water-deprived regions
								from widely adopting water desalination as a viable source of water. [4]<br/>
								&emsp;&emsp;Graphene has demonstrated unbelievable improvements to filtration efficiency, and these
								improvements place it in a category above traditional membranes. Simple graphene
								membranes already have proven to me over five times as effective as traditional
								membranes in the amount of water it lets through, [3] and recent experimentation with
								advanced forms of graphene claim to have a 10-1000 times improvement on top of that! [2]
								Molecular simulations and calculations indicate that while these improvements won’t
								result in a direct 10-1000 times reduction of power usage, [7] the actual reduction of
								power consumption noticeably reduces the operating costs. The video in Figure 5 shows a
								virtual example of how water is able to efficiently pass through a graphene membrane.
								This efficiency allows plants to tune their production to either maximize water
								production, lower costs, or reduce waste based on their needs, all while still utilizing
								less resources than traditional membranes. Production volume and costs have historically
								been the two most important barriers that have prevented the proliferation of water
								desalination installations. In overcoming the barriers, graphene membranes serve as a
								bold step towards popularizing desalination through reverse osmosis as the most
								productive method towards satisfying the world’s water needs. With the intensive ongoing
								research into graphene membranes, there are still many opportunities for further
								improvements and developments as interest both within the scientific community and
								publicly increases. Graphene membranes deliver an astonishing order of magnitude
								improvement towards filtration efficiency, and this potential makes it the inevitable
								replacement for the current standard of traditional polymer membranes. In turn, graphene
								membranes are poised to popularize water desalination as the key towards addressing the
								global water crisis.
