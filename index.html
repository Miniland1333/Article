								&emsp;&emsp;Traditional water filtration membranes lack the filtration efficiency
								required in order to serve as a universal method of obtaining purified water. [1] In
								2018, Cape Town, Africa came within days of running out of water. With the eminent
								threat of severe dehydration and resulting catastrophic organ failure, the citizens of
								Cape Town became one of many groups to realize the dry reality of running out of
								drinkable water. The depletion of existing freshwater sources due to overuse and drought
								has accelerated the need towards finding water sources that can keep up with human
								demand. Saltwater filtration, also known as saltwater desalination, provides hope
								towards adapting to meet this need, though its drawbacks have prevented widespread
								adoption: “Although the oceans and seas contain 97% of the world’s water, desalination
								today only accounts for a fraction of a percent of the world’s potable water supply.”
								[3] Recent advances in graphene, the same material found in pencil lead, have
								demonstrated significantly greater filtration efficiency over traditional materials for
								saltwater desalination and in doing so provides a solution for quenching the increasing
								global thirst for clean water. [2]</p>

															This high-pressure water at <b>(C)</b> now undergoes an
															intense round of filtering called Reverse Osmosis. Reverse
															Osmosis is the process of using high pressure to force water
															through a specialized filter called a membrane. The pores in
															this membrane are so small that only water molecules are
															allowed to pass through, while bulkier molecules are
															blocked. However, the small pore size also means that it
															takes a lot of force in order to coerce the water to squeeze
															through the pores. This difficulty directly contributes to
															the high pressures and high energy requirement of water
															desalination, as current desalination plants are forced to
															utilize pressures of up to 82 times that of atmospheric
															pressure to get water to flow though the membrane. This

															In contrast to traditional polymer membranes, graphene
															membranes are a recent development that have become a
															popular focus for desalination researchers. Fundamentally,
															graphene membranes are made up of layers of atomically-thin
															carbon sheets. Graphene is naturally quite abundant and
															serves a wide range of common applications such as graphite
															pencil lead. Figure 3 illustrates the hexagonal structure of
															graphene, which causes graphene sheets to be incredibly
															strong despite its thinness. This structure forms naturally
															at higher pressures within the earth similarly to its cousin
															coal.

															While the overall filtration process is similar, Figure 4

															Just like with the Aquaporin membrane, the unfiltered water

															been turned on its side so that the liquids flow through it
															length-wise. While only a subset of graphene membranes is
															<i>horizontal-flow</i>, or length-wise filtering, this
															subset has demonstrated the most significant improvements
															over existing membranes.

							&emsp;&emsp;While existing saltwater desalination installations have largely adopted reverse
							osmosis for production, all these installations have chosen traditional polymer membranes
							over graphene-based membranes due to their historical production-level reliability. In 2019,
							69% of the roughly 160,000 desalination plants around the globe had adopted reverse osmosis
							as their primary filtration technique, yet every one of these reverse osmosis facilities
							relied on some form of traditional polymer membranes. [4] Even though of these facilities
							were constructed since the 1980s, up until recently traditional polymer membranes were the
							only real option for reverse osmosis. As traditional membranes have had three decades of
							undivided attention, almost all of the reliability issues have been worked out and plants
							can feel confident in working with these membranes. As such, traditional membranes hold a
							monopoly over the existing 130,000 desalination plants and provide a high reliability
							threshold that alternatives struggle to match. <br/>
							&emsp;&emsp;Unfortunately, the newness of graphene membranes means that they currently lack
							the polished controls and methodologies that guarantee long-term reliability. While graphene
							has been experimented with since the 1950s, it was only within the last ten years that
							graphene-membrane research has caught the attention of researchers. [1] This explosion of
							research interest stemmed from the recent development of methodologies to synthesize large
							graphene sheets [1] and to assemble those sheets into multilayer membranes. [5] Despite all
							this attention devoted to graphene membranes and demonstrated reliability increases within
							the past few years, there still has not been enough time and developments to match the
							time-tested reliability of traditional membranes. While experimentation within a
							production-level environment would rapidly advance reliability research, no installation is
							willing to experiment with graphene due to the potential risks of experimental technologies.
							This becomes a catch-22 where graphene membranes cannot gain the approval to prove
							themselves in production precisely because they haven’t already been proven. This is a
							paradox, just as if students were judged on their college grades when attempting to apply to
							college. It would only take a single installation to start the necessary momentum, but until
							graphene membranes get their foot in the door, they are at a significant disadvantage for
							challenging the traditional membrane monopoly and convincing desalination installations to
							try out graphene membranes.

						<h2>Manufacturing Ease</h2>
						<p class="post_p">
							&emsp;&emsp;While traditional membranes have solidified their reliability over the past
							three decades, they have consistently proven to be more difficult to manufacture compared to
							their graphene competitors. In 1980, John Cadotte pioneered the procedure to manufacturing
							traditional polymer membranes that largely remains unchanged today. [6] Technicians dry
							liquid polymer on a flat surface, and this polymer dries to form the individual layers.
							These layers are highly fragile, and improper handling can cause microscopic tears that
							could compromise the membrane. Finally, technicians very carefully stack the layers to form
							the final membrane. Automation has reduced the defect rate, though this equipment cost
							increases the overall expense to produce these layers. The raw materials themselves are
							environmentally harmful if not properly contained, which adds further cost and complexity to
							the procedure in order to manage these hazardous waste products. [6] The manufacture of
							traditional polymer membranes leaves much to be desired, and this difficulty is partially
							responsible for the slow growth of new desalination installations.</p>

						<p class="post_p">
							Graphene membranes on the other hand have proven to be much easier to work with due to its
							simplicity and abundance in nature. Similarly to how coal forms within the earth, the
							atomically thin graphene sheets self-assemble from carbon molecules just through the
							application of pressure. [5] Some of the most popular graphene manufacturing methods utilize
							standard industrial rollers that supply the required pressure to press the loose carbon into
							uniform layers. [1] Not only do graphene membranes practically assemble themselves, but the
							hexagonal structure that naturally forms gives the graphene membrane both perfect flatness
							and strength. This strength enables graphene layers to be much more resistant to tearing and
							makes them significantly easier to handle and mass-produce. Since plain graphene membranes
							are made entirely out of carbon, the raw material is naturally abundant and environmentally
							benign. While this graphene structural backbone is naturally simplistic, it also has wide
							flexibility to accept chemical modifications that alter its properties. [2] This ease of
							modification has inspired the diversity in graphene-based membrane research and even allows
							for the formulation of modified graphene membranes with even high water permeability and
							strength. Graphene membranes demonstrate significant improvements in manufacturing ease and
							sustainability compared to traditional membranes at all levels of membrane complexity, and
							this ease means that graphene manufacturing is better suited to meet the increasing demand
							for desalination membranes.

						<h2>Filtration Efficiency</h2>
						<p class="post_p">
							Not only are traditional membranes inferior due to their complex and ecologically harmful
							manufacturing process, but graphene membranes critically outperform traditional membranes
							for filtration and energy efficiency. When traditional polymer membranes were initially
							adopted, they served as a significant improvement in power and production efficiencies over
							the existing thermal technologies. [4] However, within the past 30 years these traditional
							polymer membranes have only seen a small 2x improvement in overall membrane efficiency. [1]
							Due to the structure of polymer membranes, research into improving the membrane efficiency
							have not been able to deliver the significant improvements in membrane efficiency to keep up
							with increasing water demand. Not only does membrane efficiency affect the quality and
							quantity of water produced, but it also directly relates to the power costs of the reverse
							osmosis process. For a typical desalination facility, the power costs alone can account for
							up to 50% of the total costs of constructing and operating the facility. [7] These power
							costs are inversely proportional to membrane efficiency, as lower efficiency means that more
							pumps and more energy are required to force the water through the membrane. This combination
							is especially discouraging for saltwater desalination, as the immense pressure and power
							requirements can place severe strain on regional power availability. This combination of
							astronomical power consumption and relatively low water yield has kept all but the most
							desperate water-deprived regions from widely adopting water desalination as a viable source
							of water. [4]</p>

						<p class="post_p">
							Even in the short amount of research so far, graphene has already demonstrated unbelievable
							improvements to filtration efficiency that are many times better than traditional membranes.
							Simple graphene membranes already have proven to be over five times as effective as
							traditional membranes in the amount of water it lets through, [3] and recent experimentation
							with advanced forms of graphene claim to have a 10-1000 times improvement on top of that!
							[2] Molecular simulations and calculations indicate that while these improvements won’t
							result in a direct 10-1000 times reduction of power usage, [7] the actual reduction of power
							consumption noticeably reduces the operating costs. The video in Figure 5, produced by
							longtime MIT graphene membrane researcher David Cohen-Tanugi, shows the efficiency of how
							water
							passes through a graphene membrane. This efficiency allows plants to tune their production
							to either maximize water production, lower costs, or reduce waste based on their needs, all
							while still utilizing less resources than traditional membranes. Graphene membranes deliver
							an astonishing order of magnitude improvement towards filtration efficiency, and this
							potential makes it the inevitable replacement for the current standard of traditional
							polymer membranes. In turn, graphene membranes are poised to popularize water desalination
							as the key towards addressing the global water crisis.
